# Python_Scraper
I built this scraper using Python, Selenium, and BeautifulSoup to scrape a real estate site for its listings and compared listing prices to comparable homes in the area. It also found additional data about factors like nearby school ratings. Note: I have cut off the first 20 or so lines of code which contain sensitive data.
